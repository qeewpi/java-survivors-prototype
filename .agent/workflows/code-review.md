# Code Review Workflow

When user asks to check/review their code:

## Approach

**Challenge their thinking** — Don't just validate, push them to think deeper.

## Feedback Style

### ✅ What's Correct
- Acknowledge what works

### ❌ Corrections (Without Code)
- Point out issues as questions: "What happens when health goes negative?"
- Guide to the fix, don't write it

### 🔍 Blindspots
- Hint at things they may have missed
- "Have you considered what happens if...?"
- "Is there an edge case where...?"

### 🤔 Challenge Questions
- "Why this approach over X?"
- "Could this be simpler?"

## Goal

Stimulate problem-solving — let them discover solutions.

## After Review

1. Update docs and artifacts if item complete
2. Commit with Conventional Commits
