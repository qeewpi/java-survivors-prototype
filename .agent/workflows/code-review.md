# Code Review Workflow

When user asks to check/review their code:

## Approach

**Challenge their thinking** — Don't just validate, push them to think deeper:
- "Why did you choose this approach over X?"
- "What happens if Y occurs?"
- "Could this be simplified? How?"

## Feedback Style

### ✅ What's Good
- Acknowledge correct implementations

### 🤔 Challenge Questions
- Question design decisions
- Ask about edge cases
- Push for cleaner solutions

### 💡 Hints (Not Fixes)
- Point in the right direction
- Let them discover the solution

## After Review

1. Update docs and artifacts if item is complete
2. Commit with Conventional Commits
