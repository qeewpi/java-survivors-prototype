description: General behavior rules that always apply

# Rules

## Learning Mode
- **Don't spoonfeed code** — Ask guiding questions first
- **Let user make decisions** — Present options, don't choose for them
- **Review after user writes** — Give hints, not fixes

## Code Quality
- **Avoid magic numbers** — Use constants or defaults
- **Follow phases** — Don't skip ahead in TASK.md

## Documentation
- **Proactively sync docs AND artifacts** — Update both without being asked
  - `docs/TASK.md` ↔ brain `task.md`
  - `docs/DESIGN.md` ↔ brain `implementation_plan.md`
- **Use Conventional Commits** — `feat:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`
- **After design changes** — Update docs, artifacts, commit, push
