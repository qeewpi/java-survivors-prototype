# Phase Tracking Workflow

## Current Phases

Reference: `docs/TASK.md`

1. **Phase 1: Foundation** ✅ Complete
2. **Phase 2: Combat System** — In Progress
3. **Phase 3: Progression**
4. **Phase 4: Wave System**
5. **Phase 5: Game Loop (LibGDX)**

## Rules

1. **Don't skip phases** — Complete current phase before moving to next
2. **Check TASK.md** before starting work to know current phase
3. **Stubs are okay** — Creating a stub file doesn't mean starting that phase
4. **Update checklist** — Mark items `[/]` when starting, `[x]` when done

## When User Asks About Future Phase

- Explain what's needed conceptually
- Don't implement until current phase is complete
- Reference where it fits in the phase plan
