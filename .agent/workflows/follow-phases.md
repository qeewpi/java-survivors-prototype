# Phase Tracking Workflow

## Source of Truth

**Always reference `docs/TASK.md`** for current phases — don't hardcode here.

## Rules

1. **Don't skip phases** — Complete current phase before moving to next
2. **Check TASK.md first** — Read it before starting work
3. **Stubs are okay** — Creating a stub doesn't mean starting that phase
4. **Update checklist** — `[/]` when starting, `[x]` when done

## When User Asks About Future Phase

- Explain conceptually what's needed
- Don't implement until current phase is complete
- Reference where it fits in the plan

## Meta-Rule

If phases change, update `docs/TASK.md` — this file references that, not the other way around.
