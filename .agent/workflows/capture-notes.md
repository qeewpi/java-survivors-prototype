# Capture Notes

When a concept finally clicks after struggling to understand it:

## 1. Identify the Breakthrough

- What specific concept/syntax was confusing?
- What was the clarifying insight?

## 2. Keep It Specific

Don't capture topic overviews. Capture the exact breakthrough.

- Bad: "Builder Pattern"
- Good: "Self-Referential Generic `<T extends Builder<T>>`  returns subclass type, not Object"

## 3. Format

- Brief and scannable
- Bullet points, minimal code
- Focus on what made it click

## 4. Save

- Add to `docs/NOTES.md` under appropriate heading
