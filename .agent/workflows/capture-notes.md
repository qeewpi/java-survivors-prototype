# Capture Notes Workflow

Capture concepts that finally clicked after struggling to understand them.

## What to Capture

- The specific concept/syntax that was confusing
- The clarifying insight (what made it click)
- Why it was hard before vs clear now

## Keep It Specific

Don't capture topic overviews. Capture the exact breakthrough.

Bad: Builder Pattern
Good: Self-Referential Generic: <T extends Builder<T>> - returns the subclass type, not Object

## Format

Brief and scannable - bullet points, minimal code.

## Where to Save

- docs/NOTES.md
