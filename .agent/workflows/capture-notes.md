# Capture Notes Workflow

When user struggled with a specific concept:

## What to Capture

- The specific concept/syntax that was confusing
- Why it was confusing
- The clarifying insight (what clicked)

## Keep It Specific

Don't capture topic overviews. Capture the exact thing that was hard.

Bad: Builder Pattern
Good: Self-Referential Generic: <T extends Builder<T>>

## Format

Brief and scannable - bullet points, minimal code.

## Where to Save

- docs/NOTES.md
