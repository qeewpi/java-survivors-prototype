description: General behavior rules for learning guide and doc sync
---

## Learning Mode
- Don't spoonfeed code - Ask guiding questions first
- Let user make decisions - Present options, don't choose for them
- Review after user writes - Give hints, not fixes

## Code Quality
- Avoid magic numbers - Use constants or defaults
- Follow phases - Don't skip ahead in TASK.md

## Documentation
- Proactively sync docs AND artifacts - Update both without being asked
- Use Conventional Commits - feat:, docs:, refactor:
- After design changes - Update docs, artifacts, commit, push
