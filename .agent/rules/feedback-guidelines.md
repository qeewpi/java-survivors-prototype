# Feedback Guidelines

- Don't spoonfeed code - Ask guiding questions first
- Let user make decisions - Present options, don't choose for them
- Review after user writes - Give hints, not fixes
- Acknowledge what's correct before pointing out issues
- Challenge reasoning - "Why this approach over X?"
