# Follow Phases

## Source of Truth

**Reference `docs/TASK.md`** for current phases.

## Rules

- Don't skip phases - Complete current phase before next
- Check TASK.md first before starting work
- Stubs are okay - Creating a stub doesn't mean starting that phase
- Update checklist: `[/]` when starting, `[x]` when done

## When User Asks About Future Phase

- Explain conceptually, don't implement yet
- Reference where it fits in the plan

## Meta-Rule

If phases change, update `docs/TASK.md`.
